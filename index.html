    <h2>Main Message</h2>
    <p>
      The main message of Dear Martin is about how racism and racial profiling still exist.
      Racial profiling means people are judged because of the color of their skin.
      The novel shows that Black people are often treated unfairly and not equal to White people.
      It also shows that even education and good behavior can’t always change that.
      Different characters react differently to racism.
      This makes the problem very clear for the reader.

      Racism is still a serious issue in society today.
      It affects people’s daily lives and opportunities.
